# Dock Space
Since I love simplicity and minimalism, and having empty space is a principle of simplicity, I decided to develop this app for myself to make my dock more efficient and tidy.

In fact, **Dock Space** is a simple app that adds an empty space to the macOS dock so you can give it a better uniformity. This app is made for those who care about details!

## More details:
This repository and application are developed using **electron.js**. Also, **electron forge** is used to build it.

**Electron.js** is an open-source framework that allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
